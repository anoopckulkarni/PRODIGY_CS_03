# Password Strength Assessment Tool

By Anoop C Kulkarni

This Python tool assesses the strength of a password based on several criteria. It provides feedback on how to improve the password to enhance its security.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Uppercase Letters**: Verifies the presence of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
- **Lowercase Letters**: Checks for at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
- **Numbers**: Validates the inclusion of at least one digit (0-9).
- **Special Characters**: Ensures the presence of at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $).
- **Feedback**: Provides detailed feedback on how to strengthen the password.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (if hosted on a version control system like GitHub) or download the `password_strength.py` file directly.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `password_strength.py`.
   - Run the program using the command:
     ```bash
     python password_strength.py
     ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Enter a password when prompted.
   - The tool will assess the password and provide feedback on its strength based on the criteria.

## Example

### Running the Program:

```bash
Password Strength Assessment Tool
Enter a password to assess: MyPa$$w0rd!

Password Strength Feedback:
- Your password is strong.
```

### Feedback Example for a Weak Password:

```bash
Password Strength Assessment Tool
Enter a password to assess: weakpass

Password Strength Feedback:
- Password should be at least 8 characters long.
- Password should contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
- Password should contain at least one digit (0-9).
- Password should contain at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $).
- Your password is weak. It needs significant improvement.
```

## Notes

- **Password Complexity**: A strong password significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Criteria**: Meeting all the specified criteria ensures the highest level of password strength.
